### Important to remember: 
* All questions are welcomed. This is important for the group's learning process. 
* Create your own success baseline. And remember, each person has their own learning journey.
* From now on you will be introduced to a lot of new concepts and, probably, we won't have time to clarify everything during the lecture. Consider making notes of things that you would need to Google after the lecture. Not knowing something will be a common scenario in your developer career. During the bootcamp we want to empower you to be independent in your learning process. 

## Notes

### What is HTML and CSS? 
HTML and CSS are the core technologies for building pages in the web. 
* HTML gives structure to the page
* CSS provides style

### Semantic HTML
There are a lot of html tags that we can use on our code. You can consult them [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
When choosing your tags, make sure to always choose the ones that make most sense to the type of content you are displaying. 
This is very important, and will make your code:
* Lighter 
* Easier to maintain 
* Accessible
* Easier to be found by search engines
